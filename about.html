  <h1>Goals and objective</h1>
  <p >Nonprofit organizations exist mainly to provide help or resources to a target audience with a specific need.
They usually serve a public purpose such as enriching the lives of people in the community, and enjoy special
considerations in terms of tax, legal status and accountability. A nonprofit organization is mission-driven,
    which requires the management and board to set objectives aimed at achieving the organizationâ€™s stated mission.</p>
